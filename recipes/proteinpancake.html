<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Rolled oats</li>
  <li>Protein Powder</li>
  <li>Banana</li>
  <li>Egg</li>
  <li>Milk</li>
  <li>Coconut flour</li>
  <li>Cinnamon</li>
  <li>Baking powder</li>
  <li>Salt</li>
  <li>Butter</li>
</ul>
<h3>Directions</h3>
<ol>
  <li>
    Blend your oats. Add rolled oats to your blender and blend for 10-15 seconds
    or so until it is broken down into a flour consistency.
  </li>
  <li>
    Combine your dry ingredients. Add processed oats, protein powder, coconut
    flour, baking powder, cinnamon, and salt in a small bowl and mix well to
    combine.
  </li>
  <li>
    Mix your wet ingredients. In a separate medium bowl, mash your bananas until
    smooth. Add your egg, and milk and mix well to combine. Add your dry
    ingredients to your wet and mix until combined. Try not to overmix. The
    batter should be pretty thick. Let the mixture sit for 5 minutes.
  </li>
  <li>
    Cook. Heat up a large nonstick skillet or griddle over low to medium heat.
    Once hot, add cooking fat and let it warm up. Using a 1/4 cup as a scoop,
    form into equal size pancakes. I get about 5 (you may need to cook in
    batches depending on how big your pan is). Cook for 3-4 minutes until
    bubbles start to form on the outside. Flip and cook for another 1-2 minutes
    until golden brown.
