<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
  <li>2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, divided</li>
  <li>¼ cup whole-wheat panko breadcrumbs</li>
  <li>1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon minced garlic, divided</li>
  <li>1 pound boneless, skinless chicken breast, cut into 1/2-inch pieces</li>
  <li>1 teaspoon Italian seasoning</li>
  <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
  <li>3 cups low-sodium chicken broth</li>
  <li>1 ½ cups crushed tomatoes</li>
  <li>8 ounces whole-wheat penne</li>
  <li>½ cup shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
  <li>¼ cup shredded Parmesan cheese</li>
  <li>¼ cup chopped fresh basil</li>
</ul>
<h3>Directions</h3>
<ol>
  <li>
    Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a large broiler-safe skillet over medium-high heat.
    Add panko and 1 teaspoon garlic. Cook, stirring, until the panko is golden
    brown, 1 to 2 minutes. Transfer to a small bowl and set aside. Wipe out the
    pan.
  </li>
  <li>
    Heat the remaining 1 tablespoon oil in the pan over medium-high heat. Add
    chicken, Italian seasoning, salt and the remaining 1 tablespoon garlic.
    Cook, stirring frequently, until the chicken is no longer pink on the
    outside, about 2 minutes. Add broth, tomatoes and penne. Bring to a boil and
    cook, uncovered, stirring frequently, until the penne is cooked and the
    sauce has reduced and thickened, 15 to 20 minutes.
  </li>
  <li>
    Meanwhile, position an oven rack in the upper third of the oven. Preheat the
    broiler to high. When the pasta is cooked, sprinkle mozzarella over the
    penne mixture. Place the pan under the broiler; broil until the mozzarella
    is bubbling and beginning to brown, about 1 minute. Top with the panko
    mixture, Parmesan and basil.
  </li>
  <li>Enjoy!</li>
