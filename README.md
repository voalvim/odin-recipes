# odin-recipes

Repository used for the recipes project at The Odin Project.

This repository was created with the idea of being playground to test my current HTML, CSS and Git skills.

It might also be interesting to look back at it in the future to see how far I've come.

I accidentaly merged main into recipe, instead of the other way around. Yikes.
